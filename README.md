# @themost/cache
MOST Web Framework Data Caching

@themost/cache implements the default data caching strategy that is going to be used by any [@themost](https://github.com/themost-framework) data application

Important note: This module has been separated from [@themost/data](https://github.com/themost-framework/data) even if it exports the default caching strategy.

## Installation 
    npm i @themost/cache

## Configuration

`@themost/cache/platform-server#DefaultDataCachingStrategy` is being registered by `@themost/data#DataConfiguration`:

    {
        "services": [
            {
                "serviceType": "@themost/cache#DataCacheStrategy",
                "strategyType": "@themost/cache/platform-server#DefaultDataCacheStrategy"
            }
        ]
    }
        
Configure absolute expiration timeout by setting `absoluteExpiration` under `settings/cache` section:

    {
        "settings": {
            "cache": {
                "absoluteExpiration": 900
            }
        }
    }

This setting is going to be used by [node-cache](https://github.com/node-cache/node-cache#initialize-init) which is the caching engine initiated by `@themost/cache#DefaultDataCacheStrategy` strategy.

`@themost/cache/platform-server#IndexedCacheStrategy` is an alternative caching strategy which uses disk for caching items.

    {
        "services": [
            {
                "serviceType": "@themost/cache#DataCacheStrategy",
                "strategyType": "@themost/cache/platform-server#IndexedCacheStrategy"
            }
        ]
    }
    
Configure disk cache root under `settings/cache` section (the default value is `.cache/diskCache`):

    {
        "settings": {
            "cache": {
                "absoluteExpiration": 900,
                "rootDir": ".cache/diskCache"
            }
        }
    }

and the interval -in seconds- of validating the expiration of cached items: 

    {
        "settings": {
            "cache": {
                "absoluteExpiration": 900,
                "rootDir": ".cache/diskCache",
                "checkingPeriod": 60
            }
        }
    }
